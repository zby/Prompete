# Prompete

Prompete is a simple Python SDK for Large Language Models (LLMs) that combines
LiteLLM, LLMEasyTools, and Jinja2 templates to create a flexible system for
managing prompts and chat interactions. At its core, the Chat class maintains
chat history and handles prompt rendering, llm replies and processing of tool
calls.

The key concept behind templating in Prompete is to bridge the gap between
traditional software and LLMs. While conventional software primarily deals with
structured data, LLMs require both data and instructions on how to interpret and
use that data. Prompete addresses this by separating prompts into two distinct
components:

1. Data: The raw information generated by traditional software.
2. Template: Instructions for the LLM on how to interpret and reason about the
   data.

This separation allows for a more natural and flexible interface between
traditional software systems and LLMs, enabling developers to easily manage the
semantic interpretation step required for effective LLM integration.

You can start working in Prompete with simple string prompts without using
templates, then progressively adopt more advanced features as your needs evolve.

## Features

- Template-based prompt generation using Jinja2
- Integration with various LLM APIs through LiteLLM
- Easy function calling with LLMEasyTools
- Conversation management with the Chat interface
- System prompts and custom prompt roles

## Installation

Install Prompete using pip:

```bash
pip install prompete
```

## Quick Start

First you need to set up your API credentials in your environment variables.
Depending on the model you choose, you'll need to set:
- OPENAI_API_KEY for OpenAI models
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Anthropic models

For example:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'
```

### Basic example

```python
from prompete import Chat

model = "gpt-4o-mini"  # OpenAI model

# Create a Chat instance with a system prompt
chat = Chat(
    model=model,
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant specializing in Python programming."
)

# Start the conversation
user_message = "What's the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?"
response = chat(user_message)

print("User:", user_message)
print("AI:", response)
```

### Templating example

A full example of templating with Prompete can be found in the `examples/templating.py` file.

To use templating with Prompete, you need to create a Jinja2 Environment.
You can use all features of Jinja2 like multiple directories to search for template files, add
custom filters, etc.

```python
# Create a Jinja2 Environment instance with multiple template directories
renderer = Environment(
    loader=ChoiceLoader([
        FileSystemLoader(os.path.join(current_dir, "templates")),
    ])
)
```

The data is passed to the template as a subclass of `Prompt`.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TaskPrompt(Prompt):
    user_name: str
    language: str
    task: str

task_prompt = TaskPrompt(
    user_name="Alice",
    language="Python",
    task="write a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
)

print(chat(task_prompt))
```

The prompt tempalte is found by looking up the class name in the templates defined in the renderer.
The template can use the prompt fields as variables.

### Function Calling with LLMEasyTools

Prompete integrates LLMEasyTools for easy function calling:

```python
from prompete import Chat
from llm_easy_tools import LLMFunction

def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b

multiply_function = LLMFunction(multiply)

chat = Chat(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
chat.append("What is 5 times 7?")

response = chat.llm_reply(tools=[multiply_function])
result = chat.process()

print(result)
```

## Key Concepts

- **Chat**: The main class for managing conversations and interacting with LLMs.
- **Prompt**: Base class for creating custom prompt types.
- **renderer**: Jinja2 Environment for rendering prompts with dynamic content.
